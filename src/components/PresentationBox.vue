      <p>üëãüèº Greetings! I'm Ot, a 24 years old software developer.</p>
      <p>
        My speciality is the Front-End of web development, but sometimes I do
        Back-End stuff too when needed. I am proactive and I like to learn from
        new technologies to add value, that is why I am currently geeting the
        Bachelor's Degree in Techniques for Software Application Development at
        <a

      <p>
        I feel very confortable in team environments, as I believe that diverse
        perspectives an opinions usually come together to create a better final
        result. As someone who believes in continuous growth, I am convinced
        that being part of a team is allways an oportunitty to add value while
        you learn new things.

        I like to say:

          "It is obvious that a senior will for sure teach a lot of things to a
          Junior, but whatn is actually crazy, is how a senior can learn a lot
          of new things from a junior. It is a symbiosis that creates a really
          special cinergias."
